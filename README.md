# Walmart Sales Forecasting Project

This project is focused on forecasting future sales for Walmart using historical sales data. The goal is to predict sales trends to assist with inventory management and demand planning. The project employs machine learning techniques and time series forecasting methods to build accurate predictive models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical computations)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning algorithms)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (Neural networks)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)

## Project Overview

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating time-related features to capture seasonal and trend patterns.
   
2. **Model Development**:
   - Multiple machine learning models are trained, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Each model is evaluated based on performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
   
3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as GridSearch and RandomSearch are used to optimize the models for better accuracy.

4. **Forecasting and Visualization**:
   - After training the models, sales are predicted for future time periods. Results are visualized through various plots to compare actual vs. predicted sales and to better interpret the model's performance.

5. **Dashboard (optional)**:
   - An interactive dashboard (optional) is created to visualize the forecasted sales dynamically, providing a useful tool for decision-making.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
